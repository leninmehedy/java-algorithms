# Algorithms in Java
This repository contains various algorithm and data structure implementations in Java 8 that I have been practising recently.

# Steps
For any given problem follow the steps bellow as you would do in professional settings:
 - Examples: Ask for examples
 - Clarify: Ask questions to clearify input-output and constraints
 - First Solution: Find a brute-force solution and estimate time/space complexity
 - Iterate: Iterate to find new solutions and their time/space complexity
 - Approval: Ask if the solution is OK to proceed with
 - Test cases: Think about test cases: Edge cases, Base cases and Regular cases
 - Code: Write the solution. Feel free to add comments in the code. Make it as neat and clean as possible.
 - Verify: verify your code using the tests cases.

Here is the list of algorithm problems and implementations:
